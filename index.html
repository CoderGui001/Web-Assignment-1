                The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small, brown,
                fuzzy, and found in the produce section</span> of your local supermarket. But the
                kiwi is not a fruit—that's kiwifruit, which is native to eastern Asia! About the
                size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird
                found only in New Zealand.

                    The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend 
                    to be very steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and trees 
                    found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up 
                    into  trees  to  nest,  rest,  or  escape  from  danger,  the  kiwi 
                    makes  its  home  in  burrows  in  the  ground  of  its  swampy 
                    forest or grassland habitat. The bird digs multiple burrows 
                    within  its  territory,  using  strong  toes  and  claws.  Nest 
                    burrows,  dug  early  in  the  season,  become  overgrown  at 
                    the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the 
                    female is ready to lay her eggs.

                    Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other 
                    and  their  chicks,  and  males  purr  during  mating.  Pairs  do 
                    fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she 
                    is  not  in  the  mood  for  his  company.  If  another  kiwi 
                    invades a pair’s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis 
                    have  been  known  to  fight  to  the  death,  although  this  is 
                    rare.<br><br>

                    An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a 
                    female  may  choose  a  new  male  if  a  more  desirable  one 
                    wanders  by.  The  male  doesn't  have  beautiful  songs  or 
                    fancy feathers to attract a female. Instead, he follows one 
                    around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested, 
                    the female might wander off or try to scare him away.
                    Breeding  season  is  late  winter  to  early  summer.  Nests 
                    might  be  in  hollow  logs  or  in  underground  burrows  dug 
                    by the male.<br><br>
                    
                    The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs 
                    are  smooth  and  white,  off-white,  or  pale  green  in  color. 
                    They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg 
                    might  reach  up  to  20  percent  of  her weight;  that would 
                    be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving 
                    birth  to  a  24-pound  (11  kilograms)  baby!  Compared  to 
                    the  relative  weights  of  other  birds  and  their  eggs,  the 
                    female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms) 
                    rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6 
                    kilograms).<br><br>
